# Database

## Normalization
- Database normalization is about organizing data in a database efficiently
- Database normalization is the process of restructuring an existing database schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
- Normalization involves dividing a larger table into two or more tables and establishing relationships between these tables
- The objective is to isolate data in such a way that additions, deletions, and modifications can be made in one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.
- Minimizes duplicate data, Prevents data inconsistencies, Simplifies queries, Enables flexible interface design, Improves scalability

## Denormalization
- Denormalization technique Focuses on improving the search performance 
- Merges two tables in order to reduce the number of joins to speed up query performance
- 

## 1NF
- Every table must have primary key
- Every column must have atomic value
- Table must not have repeating groups
